# Data Structures and Algorithms â€“ Exercises
This repository contains the practice exercises for the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course at LUT University. Written completely in Python without external libraries.

## Topics
These exercises covered the following topics:
* **Data Structures and suitable uses:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, Heaps
* **Algorithms:** Searching, Sorting, Graph and Tree Traversal, and Problem-Solving Techniques (Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Divide & Conquer)
* **Algorithm Design and Analysis:** Complexity analysis, Big O notation, NP-completeness, Algorithm optimization techniques

### Course project
Projects includes the implementation and analysis of a hash table using open hashing with linked lists. Insert, search and delete operations were built and analyzed for their time complexity. The performance was compared to a list-based approach. The project can be found in the `project` folder.
